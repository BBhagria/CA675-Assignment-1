---HDFS:
---Uploaded all the four datasets to gcp, created a directory on hdfs. Copied all the four files to ‘myData’ directory. Below are the commands

hdfs dfs –mkdir /myData  
hdfs dfs –put CA675_1.csv /myData
---PIG
---Step 1: After uploading the merged dataset that we merged in python, we load the dataset in PIG using the LOAD operator.

dataset1 = LOAD '/mydata/CA675_1.csv' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage(',', 'YES_MULTILINE') AS (Id: int,PostTypeId:int,AcceptedAnswerId:int,ParentId:int,CreationDate:Datetime,DeletionDate:Datetime,Score:int,ViewCount:int,Body:chararray,OwnerUserId:int,OwnerDisplayName:chararray,LastEditorUserId:int,LastEditorDisplayName:chararray,LastEditDate:Datetime,LastActivityDate:Datetime,Title:chararray,Tags:chararray,AnswerCount:int,CommentCount:int,FavoriteCount:int,ClosedDate:Datetime,CommunityOwnedDate:Datetime,ContentLicense:chararray); 

---Step2: I remove the duplicates using DISTINCT operator.
 noDuplicates = DISTINCT mergedDataset;

---Step3: I remove all the records with blank OwnerUserId and Score using FILTER clause.
removenull  = FILTER noDuplicates BY (OwnerUserId IS NOT NULL) AND (Score IS NOT NULL);

---Optional Step: Count the number of records after cleaning them to check for any changes in the dataset.
allRecords = GROUP removenull  ALL;
numOfRecords = FOREACH allRecords GENERATE COUNT(removenull);
dump numOfRecords;
---numOfRecords = 194858

---Step4: Clean the textual data in the dataset using the REPLACE function.

formattedcsv = FOREACH removenull GENERATE  Id AS Id, Score AS Score, REPLACE(Body,',*','') AS Body, OwnerUserId AS OwnerUserId, REPLACE(Title,',*','') AS Title, REPLACE(Tags,',*','') AS Tags; 
cleanedData = FOREACH formattedcsv GENERATE Id AS Id, Score AS Score, REPLACE(Body,'<.+?>','') AS Body, OwnerUserId AS OwnerUserId, Title AS Title, Tags AS Tags;
cleaned = FOREACH cleanedData GENERATE $0 as Id,$1 AS Score,REPLACE($2,'\\n|\\r|<br>','') AS Body,$3 AS Ownerid,$4 AS Title,$5 AS Tags;
cleanedFinal = FOREACH cleaned GENERATE $0 AS Id,$1 AS Score, REPLACE($2,'([^a-zA-Z0-9]+)',' ') AS Body, $3 AS OwnerUserId, REPLACE($4,'([^a-zA-Z0-9]+)',' ')  AS Title, $5 AS Tags;

---Step5: Store the output to HDFS using STORE operator.

STORE cleanedFinal INTO '/mydata' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage(',', 'YES_MULTILINE', 'WINDOWS');
